This repository is a curated collection of notes, originally crafted as responses to questions from university colleagues, family, and myself, some dating back a decade. I documented these answers for future reference. During my university years, I utilized GitHub to upload my notes, ensuring easy access from any university computer or workplace. If anyone else wishes to read my old notes, they are welcome to do so.
